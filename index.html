        <p>Happy Mothers Day Mom.  I'm so lucky to have you for a mother. You are the most selfless person I know. You are kind, thoughtful, smart, beautiful and still have some kick ass dance moves. Growing up you always made me feel smart and capable of doing anything and because of that you have made me the person I am today.</p>
        <p>I'm sorry I am not in Toronto for Mothers Day again but I'm so happy I got to see you in Spain! I hope you had as much fun as I did.</p>
        <h4>I love you mom and I hope you have a fantastic mothers day! ‚ù§Ô∏è </h4>
